# kitmanTechTest

What I built:
- Login Screen 
- List of Athletes screen
- Athlete Details Screen
- Function which returns the squads that an athlete is part of in a collapsible view on the Athlete Details screen

What was important to me:
- Readable, clean code
- Reuse components where possible (InputField, ListItem)
- Typescript
- Creating a typed model for API data (athletes, squads)
- Project folder structure
- Functional components

Things I would have done if had more time:

- Add tests for screens and components
- Tabs, so user could view based on athletes or squads
- Ability to search List of Athletes by name
- Improve UI designs
- Proper logout flow
- Use flatlist on List of Athletes screen for performance improvement (I ran into issues trying to get flat list to work in this project)
